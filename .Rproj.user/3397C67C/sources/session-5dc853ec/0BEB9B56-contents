[This univariate analysis page will feature an analysis of four key demographic factors: ***Age, Gender, Education Level, and Country***. The aim is to elucidate their relationship with drug consumption patterns.]{style="font-size: 12pt; color: gray;"}

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
drug <- read.csv("Drug_Consumption_Quantified.csv")
drug <- subset(drug, Country != "-0.28519")
drug_or <- read.csv("Drug_Consumption.csv")
drug_or <- subset(drug_or, Country != "Other")
```

### Exploring Drug Consumption Patterns Across Different Age Groups

#### Three **Legal** Drugs Across Six Analyzed Countries

##### Alcohol

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(drug, aes(x = Age, y = Alcohol)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Alcohol", title = "Scatter Plot of Age vs. Alcohol")
```

##### Caffeine

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(drug, aes(x = Age, y = Caff)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Caffeine", title = "Scatter Plot of Age vs. Caffeine")
```

##### Nicotine

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(drug, aes(x = Age, y = Nicotine)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Nicotine", title = "Scatter Plot of Age vs. Nicotine")
```

#### One **Legal** Drug Across Two Analyzed Countries, but **Illegal** Across Four Others

##### Cannabis

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(drug, aes(x = Age, y = Cannabis)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Cannabis", title = "Scatter Plot of Age vs. Cannabis")
```

#### Two **Illegal** Drugs Across Six Analyzed Countries

#### Cocaine

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(drug, aes(x = Age, y = Coke)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Cocaine", title = "Scatter Plot of Age vs. Cocaine")
```

#### Heroin

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(drug, aes(x = Age, y = Heroin)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Heroin", title = "Scatter Plot of Age vs. Heroin")
```
