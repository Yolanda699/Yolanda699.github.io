[How does each demographic characteristic affect the drug consumption patterns?]{style="background-color:#fdfd96;"}

[This univariate analysis page will feature an analysis of four key demographic factors: ***Age, Gender, Education Level, and Country***. The aim is to elucidate their relationship with drug consumption patterns.<br><br> **For reference:** CL0 indicating ‘never used’, CL1 representing ‘used over a decade ago’, CL2 indicating ‘used in the last decade’, CL3 indicating ‘used in the last year’, CL4 representing ‘used in the last month’, CL5 indicating ‘used in the last week’, and CL6 representing ‘used in the last day’.]{style="font-size: 12pt; color: gray;"}

## **Legal** Drugs

These three drugs (alcohol, cafeeine and nocotine) are legal in all 6 analyzed countries.

### Alcohol

**Younger people consumes more:** The general trend indicates that younger individuals are more likely to have engaged in alcohol consumption more recently, while older age groups show a higher frequency of alcohol consumption in the more distant past, with a notable decline in recent consumption as age progresses.

**Minor gender difference:** While overall gender differences in alcohol consumption appear minimal, there are specific points of divergence. Despite these variations, both genders display a similar pattern of alcohol consumption, with the majority having consumed alcohol at some stage and only a small proportion never having consumed alcohol at all.

**Higher educational level might bring more consumption:** The relationship between education and alcohol consumption is not strongly marked at the lower consumption levels or distant past (CL0 to CL3). Still, a trend emerges at the higher levels of recent alcohol use (CL4 to CL6), where individuals with higher education, such as university graduates, show a tendency towards more frequent alcohol consumption. This could suggest that social or lifestyle factors associated with higher educational environments may influence alcohol consumption habits, leading to more frequent use among these individuals.

**Minor country difference:** Alcohol consumption is a widespread phenomenon with similar levels of engagement across the countries in question, pointing to the absence of notable distinctions in alcohol consumption habits based on country.

#### Age

There is an observable overall decline in alcohol consumption as age increases. The proportion of individuals who have never consumed alcohol (CL0) diminishes with advancing age. The peak occurrence for those who last consumed alcohol over a decade ago (CL1) is found within the 45-54 age bracket. The age group most likely to have consumed alcohol in the last decade (CL2) is 35-44. For more recent consumption categories—consumed in the last year (CL3), last month (CL4), last week (CL5), and last day (CL6)—the majority are in the youngest age group, 18-24.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

breaks <- c(-0.95197, -0.07854, 0.49788, 1.09449, 1.82213, 2.59171)
labels <- c("18-24", "25-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", "65+")

ggplot(drug, aes(x = Age, y = Alcohol)) +
  geom_violin() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks, labels = labels) +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Alcohol", title = "Age and Alcohol Consumption")
```

#### Gender

Initially, a minority of individuals report never consuming alcohol (CL0), indicating widespread alcohol use. As we move through categories such as 'used over a decade ago' (CL1) and 'used in the last decade' (CL2), there is a gradual but modest increase in consumption, with overall figures remaining relatively low. However, at 'used in the last year' (CL3), a significant surge is observed in male consumption, suggesting a higher recent intake compared to females. Interestingly, this trend reverses at 'used in the last month' (CL4), where females show a higher count, reaching their peak at 'used in the last week' (CL5). Conversely, at the highest frequency category, 'used in the last day' (CL6), males exhibit a substantial increase, surpassing females, indicating a higher prevalence of daily alcohol consumption among males.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

count_data <- drug_or %>%
  group_by(Alcohol, Gender) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

custom_colors <- c("F" = "#aed0ee", "M" = "#a3bbdb")

ggplot(count_data, aes(x = Alcohol, y = count, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(aes(label = count), position = position_dodge(width = 1), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Gender and Alcohol Consumption", x = "Alcohol Consumption Levels", y = "Count") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Education

Across all educational levels, individuals who have never consumed alcohol (CL0) exhibit generally low counts, with no particular group standing out significantly. Similarly, at the 'used over a decade ago' (CL1) level, counts remain low and evenly distributed among educational achievements. However, there's a slight increase in counts at 'used in the last decade' (CL2), particularly among those with some college or university education but no certificate or degree. As we progress to 'used in the last year' (CL3), there's a more pronounced rise in counts, especially among individuals with some college or university education. The trend becomes more varied at 'used in the last month' (CL4), where the highest counts are observed in individuals with some college or university education, followed by those with a university degree. Notably, at the 'used in the last week' (CL5) and 'used in the last day' (CL6) levels, significant counts are observed among individuals with a university degree, indicating a higher frequency of alcohol consumption within these timeframes, particularly among this educational group. Additionally, while individuals with some college education or above tend to consume more alcohol overall, it's worth noting that doctorate degree holders may consume slightly less than those in other stages of higher education, albeit still higher than those with lower education levels.

  ylim(0,250)
```

#### Country

There is a progressive increase in alcohol consumption as the timeframe from consumption narrows, with Australia experiencing a peak in the number of individuals who consumed alcohol in the last week (CL5) and maintaining the highest count for those who consumed on the last day (CL6). In contrast, the United States exhibits a peak in alcohol consumption for the 'used last month' category (CL4), followed by a significant decrease in the number of individuals consuming alcohol on the 'used last day' (CL6), indicating a drop in daily alcohol consumption. For other countries included in the analysis, the counts suggest that a substantial portion of their populations engage in alcohol consumption both in the last week (CL5) and on the last day (CL6). This consistency implies that recent alcohol consumption is a common occurrence across these countries.
