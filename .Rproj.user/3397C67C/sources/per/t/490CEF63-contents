## Research Question

How do [demographic characteristics](Univariate.qmd) and [psychological traits](Personality.qmd) (i.e., personality) influence the frequency and type of drug consumption?

## Variables Explained

Independent Variables:

| Demographic Characteristics |    Psychological Traits    |
|:---------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
|             Age             |     Agreeableness (A)      |
|           Gender            |   Conscientiousness (C)    |
|          Education          |      Extraversion (E)      |
|           Country           |      Neuroticism (N)       |
|                             | Openness to Experience (O) |

Dependent Variables:

| Types of Drugs |
|:--------------:|
|    Alcohol     |
|    Caffeine    |
|    Nicotine    |
|    Cannabis    |

[1) The consumption of each drug is categorized into seven degrees, ranging from CL0 to CL6. These categories represent various usage frequencies, with **CL0** indicating 'never used', **CL1** representing 'used over a decade ago', **CL2** indicating 'used in the last decade', **CL3** indicating 'used in the last year', **CL4** representing 'used in the last month', **CL5** indicating 'used in the last week', and **CL6** representing 'used in the last day'.]{style="font-size: 11pt;"}

[2) Drugs are categorized into three groups based on their legal status across six examined countries: legal drugs, controversial drugs, and illegal drugs. Legal drugs are those permitted in all six countries; controversial drugs are legal in some but not all countries; illegal drugs are prohibited across all six countries. <br> <br> Specifically, **Alcohol, Caffeine, and Nicotine** fall under the classification of legal drugs, while **Cannabis** is categorized as a controversial drug. **Cocaine** and Heroin are classified as illegal drugs.]{style="font-size: 11pt;"}

## Why This Data Analysis is Important?

1.  According to **Saah (2005)**, addiction is often triggered by the natural reward system’s conversion of “liking” into “wanting,” emphasizing the importance of addressing drug use issues due to their addictive nature, which can result in persistent challenges in quitting.
2.  **Strickland & Smith (2014)** outlined the influence of social context on individuals’ propensity towards drug use, thus analyzing personal experiences (e.g., demography, personality) and drug use can tailor intervention strategies to prevent or mitigate drug-related harm before addiction.
3.  According to **Fox et al. (2013)**, drug abusers are estimated to commit millions of drug-motivated crimes annually; therefore, developing preemptive strategies to address drug use can enhance public safety and alleviate the societal burden associated with drug-related offenses.
