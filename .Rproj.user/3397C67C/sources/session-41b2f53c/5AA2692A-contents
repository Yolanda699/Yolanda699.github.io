## Research Question

How do demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and psychological traits influence the frequency
and type of drug consumption?

## Why This Data Analysis is Important?

1. According to **Saah (2005)**, addiction is often triggered by the natural reward system’s conversion of “liking” into “wanting,” emphasizing the importance of addressing drug use issues due to their addictive
nature, which can result in persistent challenges in quitting.
2. **Strickland & Smith (2014)** outlined the influence of social context on individuals’ propensity towards drug use, thus analyzing personal experiences (e.g., demography, personality) and drug use can tailor intervention strategies to prevent or mitigate drug-related harm before addiction.
3. According to **Fox et al. (2013)**, drug abusers are estimated to commit millions of drug-motivated crimes annually; therefore, developing preemptive strategies to address drug use can enhance public safety
and alleviate the societal burden associated with drug-related offenses.
