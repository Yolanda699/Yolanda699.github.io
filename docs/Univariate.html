<p><span style="background-color:#fdfd96;">How does each demographic characteristic affect the drug consumption patterns?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: gray;">This univariate analysis page will feature an analysis of four key demographic factors: <strong><em>Age, Gender, Education Level, and Country</em></strong>. The aim is to elucidate their relationship with drug consumption patterns.<br><br> <strong>For reference:</strong> CL0 indicating ‘never used’, CL1 representing ‘used over a decade ago’, CL2 indicating ‘used in the last decade’, CL3 indicating ‘used in the last year’, CL4 representing ‘used in the last month’, CL5 indicating ‘used in the last week’, and CL6 representing ‘used in the last day’. <br><br> <strong>Note:</strong> This dataset contains 1766 participants, with 905 females and 861 males.</span></p>
<section id="legal-drugs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="legal-drugs"><strong>Legal</strong> Drugs</h2>
<p>These three drugs (alcohol, cafeeine and nocotine) are legal in all 6 analyzed countries.</p>
<section id="alcohol" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alcohol">Alcohol</h3>
<p>The majority of participants consume alcohol with some regularity, with monthly (CL4), weekly (CL5), or daily (CL6) consumption being the most reported.</p>
<p><strong>Younger people consume more:</strong> Younger individuals are more likely to have engaged in alcohol consumption more recently, while older age groups show a higher frequency of alcohol consumption in the more distant past, with a notable decline in recent consumption as age progresses.</p>
<p><strong>Minor difference caused by gender:</strong> While overall gender differences in alcohol consumption appear minimal, there are specific points of divergence. Despite these variations, both genders display a similar pattern of alcohol consumption, with the majority having consumed alcohol at some stage and only a small proportion never having consumed alcohol at all.</p>
<p><strong>Minor difference caused by educational background:</strong> Alcohol consumption patterns, especially at higher consumption levels, do not differ significantly across different educational levels.</p>
<p><strong>Differences caused by country seen in more recent consumption, with Ireland consumes more:</strong> There is a consistent pattern of alcohol non-consumption to distant past consumption across the six compared countries. However, when examining more recent alcohol consumption, distinct differences between countries emerge. Specifically, the Republic of Ireland exhibit highest frequency of consuming alcohol.</p>
<section id="age" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="age">Age</h4>
<p>There is an observable overall decline in alcohol consumption as age increases. The proportion of individuals who have never consumed alcohol (CL0) diminishes with advancing age. The peak occurrence for those who last consumed alcohol over a decade ago (CL1) is found within the 45-54 age bracket. The age group most likely to have consumed alcohol in the last decade (CL2) is 35-44. For more recent consumption categories—consumed in the last year (CL3), last month (CL4), last week (CL5), and last day (CL6)—the majority are in the youngest age group, 18-24.</p>

<section id="gender" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gender">Gender</h4>
<p>A smaller portion of the surveyed population, 16.68% of females and 19.05% of males, includes individuals who have never consumed alcohol (CL0) or those who last consumed alcohol up to a year ago (CL3). The overall data suggests that the difference in alcohol consumption patterns between genders is negligible. The largest observed difference is in the weekly consumption category (CL5), where 42.98% of females and 37.51% of males reported consumption, yet this difference is not considered significant.</p>

<section id="education" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="education">Education</h4>

<section id="country" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="country">Country</h4>
<p>The percentages of individuals abstaining from alcohol consumption (CL0) to those who consumed this decade (CL2) exhibit comparable trends across six countries. However, notable disparities emerge among those consuming alcohol within the recent year (CL3) up to consumption within the last day (CL6). New Zealand stands out for a higher prevalence of alcohol consumption this year or last day, while Canada exhibits a higher frequency of consumption within the month, and the Republic of Ireland sees more individuals consuming within the week.</p>

<section id="caffeine" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="caffeine">Caffeine</h3>
<p>The majority of participants consume caffeine with some regularity, with daily (CL6) consumption being the most reported.</p>
<p><strong>Younger people consume more:</strong> Younger adults exhibiting more frequent usage. This trend suggests that caffeine consumption may decrease as individuals age, particularly after passing the 55-year mark.</p>
<p><strong>Minor difference caused by gender:</strong> Both males and females exhibit similar patterns of caffeine consumption, with both genders showing a high level of caffeine intake. There is no significant gender difference influencing the frequency of caffeine consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Certain difference caused by educational background:</strong> Individuals who left school at the age of 17 exhibit a higher incidence of caffeine consumption on a more frequent basis compared to other educational background groups. However, it is important to note that this difference could potentially be due to chance, <em>warranting further investigation</em>.</p>
<p><strong>All countries listed consume caffeine, with Ireland ranking as the highest consumer:</strong> Each country exhibits a significant frequency of caffeine consumption in the past day, with Ireland notably leading in the highest level of consumption, while other countries surpass Ireland in the second-highest level of consumption.</p>
<section id="age-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="age-1">Age</h4>
<p>Last-week (CL5) and last-day (CL6) caffeine consumption is predominantly observed in the younger age brackets, specifically those aged 18-24 and 25-34. There is a noticeable decline in caffeine consumption among individuals in the 55-64 age group. Furthermore, the peak of caffeine consumption ‘over a decade ago’ (CL1) is most evident in the 35-44 age category, which aligns with the finding that caffeine consumption is most prevalent among those currently in the 18-24 and 25-34 age groups.</p>

<p>The majority of participants either report never consuming nicotine or consuming it with some regularity, with non-consumption (CL0) and daily consumption (CL6) being the most frequently reported.</p>
<p><strong>Younger people consume more:</strong> Nicotine consumption tends to be higher among younger individuals, with a decreasing trend in regular consumption as age increases. Notably, a majority of individuals over 55 years old exhibit a trend of non-consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Males consume more:</strong> A significant gender disparity exists in nicotine consumption, with males consuming more than females.</p>
<p><strong>Higher education leads to less frequent consumption:</strong> There is an observed trend where individuals who quit school earlier have a higher proportion of nicotine consumers, while those in higher education exhibit fewer nicotine consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Ireland consumes most, the UK consumes least:</strong> Although there are no significant differences observed among countries for average nicotine consumption levels, notable disparities are evident in the extreme consumption categories: individuals consuming nicotine in the last day and those who never consume. The Republic of Ireland shows a significant proportion of individuals consuming nicotine in the last day, whereas the UK exhibits a significant proportion of individuals who never consume nicotine.</p>
<section id="age-2" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="age-2">Age</h4>
<p>The age group 18-24 exhibits a peak in nicotine consumption this month (CL4), while the 25-34 age group peaks at consumption over the decade (CL2), consistent with their overall higher nicotine consumption levels. Similar trends are observed for the 35-44 and 45-54 age groups, albeit with decreasing frequency as age increases. Notably, nicotine consumption over the decade (CL2), this year (CL3), this month (CL4), and this week (CL5) is absent in the 55-64 and 65+ age groups</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="heroin">Heroin</h3>
<p>The majority of participants never consume heroin (CL0).</p>
<p><strong>Young people consume more:</strong> Heroin consumption in recent times decreases as age increases, with individuals over 55 showing a tendency to abstain from heroin consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Minor difference caused by gender:</strong> Both males and females show a tendency to not consume heroin, with no significant differences observed between genders.</p>
<p><strong>Minor difference caused by educational background:</strong> Heroin consumption patterns do not exhibit significant differences among individuals with varying educational backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>The UK consumes least:</strong> Most countries generally maintain a low level of consumption. The UK stands out with a significant number of non-consumers. Although New Zealand still has some heroin consumers, they typically only consumed it a long time ago.</p>
<section id="age-5" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="age-5">Age</h4>
<p>Individuals aged 18-24 and over 55-64 are absent from consuming heroin over a decade ago (CL1). The majority of individuals aged 18-24 are categorized as consuming heroin last day (CL6) and last month (CL4). Consumption decreases among those aged 25-34, with more individuals categorized as having consumed heroin in the last decade (CL2) or last year (CL3). For individuals aged 35-44 and 45-54, the proportion of those who consumed heroin a decade ago (CL1) gradually increases.</p>
