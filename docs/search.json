    "section": "Legal Drugs",
    "text": "Legal Drugs\nThese three drugs (alcohol, cafeeine and nocotine) are legal in all 6 analyzed countries.\n\nAlcohol\nThe majority of participants consume alcohol with some regularity, with monthly (CL4), weekly (CL5), or daily (CL6) consumption being the most reported.\nYounger people consume more: Younger individuals are more likely to have engaged in alcohol consumption more recently, while older age groups show a higher frequency of alcohol consumption in the more distant past, with a notable decline in recent consumption as age progresses.\nMinor difference caused by gender: While overall gender differences in alcohol consumption appear minimal, there are specific points of divergence. Despite these variations, both genders display a similar pattern of alcohol consumption, with the majority having consumed alcohol at some stage and only a small proportion never having consumed alcohol at all.\nMinor difference caused by educational background: Alcohol consumption patterns, especially at higher consumption levels, do not differ significantly across different educational levels.\nDifferences caused by country seen in more recent consumption: There is a consistent pattern of alcohol non-consumption to distant past consumption across the six compared countries. However, when examining more recent alcohol consumption, distinct differences between countries emerge. Specifically, New Zealand, Canada, and the Republic of Ireland exhibit higher frequencies of drinking.\n\nAge\nThere is an observable overall decline in alcohol consumption as age increases. The proportion of individuals who have never consumed alcohol (CL0) diminishes with advancing age. The peak occurrence for those who last consumed alcohol over a decade ago (CL1) is found within the 45-54 age bracket. The age group most likely to have consumed alcohol in the last decade (CL2) is 35-44. For more recent consumption categories‚Äîconsumed in the last year (CL3), last month (CL4), last week (CL5), and last day (CL6)‚Äîthe majority are in the youngest age group, 18-24.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender\nA smaller portion of the surveyed population, 16.68% of females and 19.05% of males, includes individuals who have never consumed alcohol (CL0) or those who last consumed alcohol up to a year ago (CL3). The overall data suggests that the difference in alcohol consumption patterns between genders is negligible. The largest observed difference is in the weekly consumption category (CL5), where 42.98% of females and 37.51% of males reported consumption, yet this difference is not considered significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\nThe graph illustrates minimal variations in alcohol consumption across different educational levels. While there is a slight trend suggesting higher alcohol consumption among individuals with higher educational backgrounds, the differences are not significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nThe percentages of individuals abstaining from alcohol consumption (CL0) to those who consumed this decade (CL2) exhibit comparable trends across six countries. However, notable disparities emerge among those consuming alcohol within the recent year (CL3) up to consumption within the last day (CL6). New Zealand stands out for a higher prevalence of alcohol consumption this year or last day, while Canada exhibits a higher frequency of consumption within the month, and the Republic of Ireland sees more individuals consuming within the week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaffeine\nThe majority of participants consume caffeine with some regularity, with daily (CL6) consumption being the most reported.\nYounger people consume more: Younger adults exhibiting more frequent usage. This trend suggests that caffeine consumption may decrease as individuals age, particularly after passing the 55-year mark.\nMinor difference caused by gender: Both males and females exhibit similar patterns of caffeine consumption, with both genders showing a high level of caffeine intake. There is no significant gender difference influencing the frequency of caffeine consumption.\nCertain difference caused by educational background: Individuals who left school at the age of 17 exhibit a higher incidence of caffeine consumption on a more frequent basis compared to other educational background groups. However, it is important to note that this difference could potentially be due to chance, warranting further investigation.\nMinor difference caused by country: All countries exhibit a high frequency of consuming caffeine in the last day, with no significant differences observed among them.\n\nAge\nLast-week (CL5) and last-day (CL6) caffeine consumption is predominantly observed in the younger age brackets, specifically those aged 18-24 and 25-34. There is a noticeable decline in caffeine consumption among individuals in the 55-64 age group. Furthermore, the peak of caffeine consumption ‚Äòover a decade ago‚Äô (CL1) is most evident in the 35-44 age category, which aligns with the finding that caffeine consumption is most prevalent among those currently in the 18-24 and 25-34 age groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender\nThe majority of surveyed individuals consume caffeine either on a daily basis (CL6), with 24.64% female and 29.15% male respondents, or on a weekly basis (CL5), with 42.98% females and 37.51% males. However, the gender difference in caffeine consumption frequency is not significantly pronounced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n‚ÄúIndividuals who left school at 17 years of age exhibit notably higher last-day (CL6) caffeine consumption compared to other educational backgrounds, despite similar proportions. Conversely, their last-week (CL5) caffeine consumption is significantly lower compared to other educational groups, despite similar proportions.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nThe Republic of Ireland exhibits the highest proportion of individuals consuming caffeine in the last day (CL6), indicating a notable prevalence of high-frequency consumption. Moreover, across all six countries, the overall consumption remains substantial, with each country reporting more than 58% of individuals consuming caffeine at this high frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNicotine\nThe majority of participants either report never consuming nicotine or consuming it with some regularity, with non-consumption (CL0) and daily consumption (CL6) being the most frequently reported.\nYounger people consume more: Nicotine consumption tends to be higher among younger individuals, with a decreasing trend in regular consumption as age increases. Notably, a majority of individuals over 55 years old exhibit a trend of non-consumption.\nMales consume more: A significant gender disparity exists in nicotine consumption, with males consuming more than females.\nHigher education leads to less frequent consumption: There is an observed trend where individuals who quit school earlier have a higher proportion of nicotine consumers, while those in higher education exhibit fewer nicotine consumers.\nIreland consumes most, the UK consumes least: Although there are no significant differences observed among countries for average nicotine consumption levels, notable disparities are evident in the extreme consumption categories: individuals consuming nicotine in the last day and those who never consume. The Republic of Ireland shows a significant proportion of individuals consuming nicotine in the last day, whereas the UK exhibits a significant proportion of individuals who never consume nicotine.\n\nAge\nThe age group 18-24 exhibits a peak in nicotine consumption this month (CL4), while the 25-34 age group peaks at consumption over the decade (CL2), consistent with their overall higher nicotine consumption levels. Similar trends are observed for the 35-44 and 45-54 age groups, albeit with decreasing frequency as age increases. Notably, nicotine consumption over the decade (CL2), this year (CL3), this month (CL4), and this week (CL5) is absent in the 55-64 and 65+ age groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender\nAt the level of non-consumption (CL0), females comprise 83.56% more than males. Conversely, at the level of consumption within the last day (CL6), males exceed females by 40.26%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\nIndividuals who left school before 16 years, at 16 years, at 17 years, and at 18 years tend to exhibit a higher percentage of nicotine consumption within the last day (CL6). Conversely, individuals with doctorate degrees, master‚Äôs degrees, university degrees, and professional certificates show a higher proportion of non-nicotine consumers (CL0).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nThe Republic of Ireland exhibits a significantly higher proportion of individuals consuming nicotine within the last day (CL6), while New Zealand has a notably lower proportion. Conversely, the UK shows the highest proportion of individuals not consuming nicotine (CL0), whereas the Republic of Ireland has the lowest."

While other consumption levels have a similar share between genders, there is a notable disparity in cocaine consumption this decade (CL3), with 74.47% more males than females reporting consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\nThere is no significant difference in cocaine consumption across educational levels. However, individuals who left school at 18 years old and those with master‚Äôs degrees tend to have a higher proportion of non-consumers of cocaine (CL0).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nThe frequency of cocaine consumption is low across all surveyed countries. The UK has a slightly higher proportion of non-consumers (CL0), followed by New Zealand. New Zealand also exhibits the highest rate of individuals consuming cocaine over a decade ago (CL1). By contrast, the US has the lowest proportion of people who never consume cocaine (CL0).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeroin\nThe majority of participants never consume heroin (CL0).\nYoung people consume more: Heroin consumption in recent times decreases as age increases, with individuals over 55 showing a tendency to abstain from heroin consumption.\nMinor difference caused by gender: Both males and females show a tendency to not consume heroin, with no significant differences observed between genders.\nMinor difference caused by educational background: Heroin consumption patterns do not exhibit significant differences among individuals with varying educational backgrounds.\nNew Zealand consumes most, the UK consumes least: The UK has a significant number of non-consumers. New Zealand still has some consumers, albeit with less frequent consumption patterns.\n\nAge\nIndividuals aged 18-24 and over 55-64 are absent from consuming heroin over a decade ago (CL1). The majority of individuals aged 18-24 are categorized as consuming heroin last day (CL6) and last month (CL4). Consumption decreases among those aged 25-34, with more individuals categorized as having consumed heroin in the last decade (CL2) or last year (CL3). For individuals aged 35-44 and 45-54, the proportion of those who consumed heroin a decade ago (CL1) gradually increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender\n89.83% of females and 80.14% of males report never consuming heroin (CL0), with no significant gender differences observed across other consumption levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\nIndividuals with doctorate degrees, master‚Äôs degrees, university degrees, and some professional certificates tend to exhibit a slightly larger proportion of non-consumers of heroin (CL0), although the difference is not significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nThe UK has the largest proportion of people who never consume heroin (CL0), whereas New Zealand has the least. Additionally, New Zealand exhibits a significantly higher proportion of people consuming heroin in the last decade (CL2) compared to other countries."

    "text": "About different drugs\n\nAlcohol\nA Legal Staple with Minimal Personality Impact?\nQ: How does alcohol consumption vary among participants?\nA: Alcohol is a common fixture in the lives of the study‚Äôs participants, with younger people tending to drink more frequently. Despite minor gender differences, the general pattern of alcohol consumption is similar across the board.\nQ: What‚Äôs the relationship between alcohol and personality traits?\nA: Interestingly, alcohol consumption doesn‚Äôt seem to demonstrate a significant relationship with any of the Big Five personality traits. This suggests that, while popular, alcohol may not be a defining factor in shaping these particular aspects of personality.\n\n\nCaffeine\nA Daily Ritual Across Demographics\nQ: Is caffeine as widely consumed as alcohol?\nA: Absolutely, caffeine consumption is a daily ritual for the majority of participants, showing a decline with age but little variation across genders or countries.\nQ: Does personality scores influence caffeine consumption?\nA: Like alcohol, caffeine intake doesn‚Äôt present a strong link to the Big Five personality traits. It appears to be a universal habit with limited impact on the personality measures in question.\n\n\nNicotine\nDivergent Usage with Subtle Personality Ties\nQ: Can we see clear patterns in nicotine consumption?\nA: Nicotine use is divided, with a significant portion never using it and others using it daily. Men and those with less education are more inclined toward regular use, while older age groups show a trend of non-consumption.\nQ: What‚Äôs the effect of nicotine on personality?\nA: There‚Äôs a hint of a weak negative relationship between nicotine consumption and Agreeableness and Conscientiousness scores, but the overall impact on personality is not strongly pronounced.\n\n\nCannabis\nA Controversial Substance with Notable Personality Links\nQ: How common is cannabis use among the participants?\nA: Cannabis consumption patterns reveal that it‚Äôs less common than legal drugs, with more frequent use among younger males and a trend toward non-consumption with higher education.\nQ: Does cannabis use correlate with personality traits?\nA: Yes, cannabis shows a positive correlation with Neuroticism and Openness, suggesting that its use might be associated with certain personality dimensions more so than legal drugs.\n\n\nCocaine\nAn Illegal Drug with a Defined Personality Profile?\nQ: What are the consumption trends for cocaine?\nA: Cocaine is the least consumed among the substances studied, with a higher prevalence of use among younger individuals and men in the past decade. Usage does not significantly vary with education level.\nQ: Are there personality traits associated with cocaine use?\nA: Cocaine consumption is negatively related to Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, with some indications of a negative impact on Extraversion. It also correlates positively with Neuroticism, suggesting a more pronounced personality profile among users.\n\n\nHeroin\nRare Use with Clear Personality Implications\nQ: Is heroin usage as low as cocaine?\nA: Yes, heroin has a similar low consumption level, with most participants reporting they‚Äôve never used it. Its use decreases with age, and there are no notable gender or educational differences.\nQ: How does heroin relate to personality scores?\nA: Heroin usage exhibits a negative relationship with Agreeableness and Conscientiousness and may negatively affect Extraversion. Like cocaine, heroin use shows a positive correlation with Neuroticism, aligning with a more defined personality impact. There‚Äôs also a suggestion of a positive relationship with Openness, though this seems to plateau at higher consumption levels."

    "text": "About general trends\n\nTrend Analysis\nSubstance Legality and Personality Impact\nQ: Do legal and illegal drugs show different impacts on personality?\nA: Indeed, legal drugs such as alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine have a minimal effect on personality scores, whereas the controversial and illegal substances, cannabis, cocaine, and heroin, show stronger associations with certain personality traits.\nQ: Could the legality of these substances influence consumption patterns?\nA: The legality of a substance definitely influences consumption patterns. Legal drugs are more regularly consumed across a wider demographic, reflecting societal norms and acceptance. However, consumption of illegal drugs like cocaine and heroin is less frequent and often concentrated in specific age groups or demographics, likely due to legal restrictions and associated social stigma. Despite this, the influence of illegal drugs on personality scores is more significant, suggesting that their use, albeit less common, may have a more profound impact on certain personality traits compared to legal substances. This underscores the complex relationship between the legal status of a drug, its societal perception, and its potential psychological effects."

    "text": "Preventative Measures and Recommendations\n\nAdvice for Individuals\nQ: Given the observed patterns of substance use, how can individuals better safeguard themselves against potential misuse?\nA: In light of the study‚Äôs insights, individuals should be particularly mindful of their substance use habits, especially if they fall into a demographic that is more susceptible according to the findings (e.g., younger individuals with alcohol and cannabis). It‚Äôs wise to actively seek information on the health and personality implications of substance use and to cultivate a support network. Awareness of one‚Äôs own patterns can guide healthier choices, and engaging in wellbeing-promoting activities may help mitigate the appeal of substances as a coping mechanism.\n\n\nEducational Initiatives\nQ: How can education play a role in substance use prevention?\nA: Educational institutions have a pivotal role in providing comprehensive drug education that goes beyond mere abstinence messaging. Programmes should focus on critical thinking about substance use, understanding the legal, social, and health implications, and fostering skills that support resilience and informed decision-making. This education should be age-appropriate, culturally sensitive, and inclusive of the diverse experiences and backgrounds of students.\n\n\nGovernmental Strategies\nQ: What strategies should the government consider to prevent substance misuse?\nA: Governments should consider the specific consumption patterns and personality score correlations identified in the study to inform their prevention strategies. This may involve creating public health initiatives that directly address the substances with the most significant personality impacts, such as the negative relationship between heroin use and Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Tailoring policies to reflect the consumption trends in different countries, and focusing on the most affected demographics, can lead to more effective interventions. Support systems, public education, and research investment are essential for developing nuanced approaches that go beyond mere regulation and look towards holistic harm reduction."
