The aim is to elucidate their relationship with drug consumption patterns.<br><br> **For reference:** CL0 indicating ‘never used’, CL1 representing ‘used over a decade ago’, CL2 indicating ‘used in the last decade’, CL3 indicating ‘used in the last year’, CL4 representing ‘used in the last month’, CL5 indicating ‘used in the last week’, and CL6 representing ‘used in the last day’. <br><br> **Note:** This dataset contains 1766 participants, with 905 females and 861 males.]{style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: gray;\"}\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}\ndrug <- read.csv(\"Drug_Consumption_Quantified.csv\")\ndrug <- subset(drug, Country != \"-0.28519\")\ndrug_or <- read.csv(\"Drug_Consumption.csv\")\ndrug_or <- subset(drug_or, Country != \"Other\")\n```\n\n\nThese three drugs (alcohol, cafeeine and nocotine) are legal in all 6 analyzed countries.\n\n### Alcohol\n\nThe majority of participants consume alcohol with some regularity, with monthly (CL4), weekly (CL5), or daily (CL6) consumption being the most reported.\n\n**Younger people consume more:** Younger individuals are more likely to have engaged in alcohol consumption more recently, while older age groups show a higher frequency of alcohol consumption in the more distant past, with a notable decline in recent consumption as age progresses.\n\n**Minor difference caused by gender:** While overall gender differences in alcohol consumption appear minimal, there are specific points of divergence. Despite these variations, both genders display a similar pattern of alcohol consumption, with the majority having consumed alcohol at some stage and only a small proportion never having consumed alcohol at all.\n\n**Minor difference caused by educational background:** Alcohol consumption patterns, especially at higher consumption levels, do not differ significantly across different educational levels.\n\n**Differences caused by country seen in more recent consumption:** There is a consistent pattern of alcohol non-consumption to distant past consumption across the six compared countries. However, when examining more recent alcohol consumption, distinct differences between countries emerge. Specifically, New Zealand, Canada, and the Republic of Ireland exhibit higher frequencies of drinking.\n\n#### Age\n\nThere is an observable overall decline in alcohol consumption as age increases. The proportion of individuals who have never consumed alcohol (CL0) diminishes with advancing age. The peak occurrence for those who last consumed alcohol over a decade ago (CL1) is found within the 45-54 age bracket. The age group most likely to have consumed alcohol in the last decade (CL2) is 35-44. For more recent consumption categories—consumed in the last year (CL3), last month (CL4), last week (CL5), and last day (CL6)—the majority are in the youngest age group, 18-24.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nbreaks <- c(-0.95197, -0.07854, 0.49788, 1.09449, 1.82213, 2.59171)\nlabels <- c(\"18-24\", \"25-34\", \"35-44\", \"45-54\", \"55-64\", \"65+\")\n\nggplot(drug, aes(x = Age, y = Alcohol)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks, labels = labels) +\n  labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Alcohol\", title = \"Age and Alcohol Consumption\")\n```\n\n#### Gender\n\nA smaller portion of the surveyed population, 16.68% of females and 19.05% of males, includes individuals who have never consumed alcohol (CL0) or those who last consumed alcohol up to a year ago (CL3). The overall data suggests that the difference in alcohol consumption patterns between genders is negligible. The largest observed difference is in the weekly consumption category (CL5), where 42.98% of females and 37.51% of males reported consumption, yet this difference is not considered significant.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ncount_data <- drug_or %>%\n  group_by(Alcohol, Gender) %>%\n  summarise(count = n())\n\ncustom_colors <- c(\"F\" = \"#aed0ee\", \"M\" = \"#a3bbdb\")\n\nggplot(count_data, aes(x = Alcohol, y = count, fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = count), position = position_dodge(width = 1), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Gender and Alcohol Consumption\", x = \"Alcohol Consumption Levels\", y = \"Count\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n#### Education\n\nThe graph illustrates minimal variations in alcohol consumption across different educational levels.

However, notable disparities emerge among those consuming alcohol within the recent year (CL3) up to consumption within the last day (CL6). New Zealand stands out for a higher prevalence of alcohol consumption this year or last day, while Canada exhibits a higher frequency of consumption within the month, and the Republic of Ireland sees more individuals consuming within the week.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ncountry_alcohol_counts <- drug_or %>%\n  group_by(Country, Alcohol) %>%\n  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%\n  group_by(Country) %>%\n  mutate(percentage = count / sum(count) * 100)\n\ncountry_alcohol_counts$Country <- factor(country_alcohol_counts$Country)\n\ncustom_colours <- c(\"#aed0ee\", \"#a3bbdb\", \"#88abda\", \"#8aabcc\", \"#6f94cd\", \"#5976ba\", \"#106898\", \"#12507b\", \"#003460\")\n\nggplot(country_alcohol_counts, aes(x = Country, y = percentage, color = Alcohol, group = Alcohol)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = custom_colours, name = \"Consumption Level\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100), expand = c(0, 0)) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)  # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability\n  ) +\n  labs(title = \"Country and Alcohol Consumption\",\n       x = \"Countries of origin\",\n       y = \"Percentage\",\n       color = \"Consumption Level\")\n```\n\n### Caffeine\n\nThe majority of participants consume caffeine with some regularity, with daily (CL6) consumption being the most reported.\n\n**Younger people consume more:** Younger adults exhibiting more frequent usage. This trend suggests that caffeine consumption may decrease as individuals age, particularly after passing the 55-year mark.\n\n**Minor difference caused by gender:** Both males and females exhibit similar patterns of caffeine consumption, with both genders showing a high level of caffeine intake. There is no significant gender difference influencing the frequency of caffeine consumption.\n\n**Certain difference caused by educational background:** Individuals who left school at the age of 17 exhibit a higher incidence of caffeine consumption on a more frequent basis compared to other educational background groups. However, it is important to note that this difference could potentially be due to chance, *warranting further investigation*.\n\n**Minor difference caused by country:** All countries exhibit a high frequency of consuming caffeine in the last day, with no significant differences observed among them.\n\n#### Age\n\nLast-week (CL5) and last-day (CL6) caffeine consumption is predominantly observed in the younger age brackets, specifically those aged 18-24 and 25-34. There is a noticeable decline in caffeine consumption among individuals in the 55-64 age group. Furthermore, the peak of caffeine consumption 'over a decade ago' (CL1) is most evident in the 35-44 age category, which aligns with the finding that caffeine consumption is most prevalent among those currently in the 18-24 and 25-34 age groups.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nbreaks <- c(-0.95197, -0.07854, 0.49788, 1.09449, 1.82213, 2.59171)\nlabels <- c(\"18-24\", \"25-34\", \"35-44\", \"45-54\", \"55-64\", \"65+\")\n\nggplot(drug, aes(x = Age, y = Caff)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks, labels = labels) +\n  labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Caffeine\", title = \"Age and Caffeine Consumption\")\n```\n\n#### Gender\n\nThe majority of surveyed individuals consume caffeine either on a daily basis (CL6), with 24.64% female and 29.15% male respondents, or on a weekly basis (CL5), with 42.98% females and 37.51% males. However, the gender difference in caffeine consumption frequency is not significantly pronounced.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ncount_data <- drug_or %>%\n  group_by(Caff, Gender) %>%\n  summarise(count = n())\n\ncustom_colors <- c(\"F\" = \"#aed0ee\", \"M\" = \"#a3bbdb\")\n\nggplot(count_data, aes(x = Caff, y = count, fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = count), position = position_dodge(width = 1), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Gender and Caffeine Consumption\", x = \"Caffeine Consumption Levels\", y = \"Count\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n#### Education\n\n\"Individuals who left school at 17 years of age exhibit notably higher last-day (CL6) caffeine consumption compared to other educational backgrounds, despite similar proportions.

Moreover, across all six countries, the overall consumption remains substantial, with each country reporting more than 58% of individuals consuming caffeine at this high frequency.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ncountry_caff_counts <- drug_or %>%\n  group_by(Country, Caff) %>%\n  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%\n  group_by(Country) %>%\n  mutate(percentage = count / sum(count) * 100)\n\ncountry_caff_counts$Country <- factor(country_caff_counts$Country)\n\ncustom_colours <- c(\"#aed0ee\", \"#a3bbdb\", \"#88abda\", \"#8aabcc\", \"#6f94cd\", \"#5976ba\", \"#106898\", \"#12507b\", \"#003460\")\n\nggplot(country_caff_counts, aes(x = Country, y = percentage, color = Caff, group = Caff)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = custom_colours, name = \"Consumption Level\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100), expand = c(0, 0)) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)  # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability\n  ) +\n  labs(title = \"Country and Caffeine Consumption\",\n       x = \"Countries of origin\",\n       y = \"Percentage\",\n       color = \"Consumption Level\")\n```\n\n### Nicotine\n\nThe majority of participants either report never consuming nicotine or consuming it with some regularity, with non-consumption (CL0) and daily consumption (CL6) being the most frequently reported.\n\n**Younger people consume more:** Nicotine consumption tends to be higher among younger individuals, with a decreasing trend in regular consumption as age increases. Notably, a majority of individuals over 55 years old exhibit a trend of non-consumption.\n\n**Males consume more:** A significant gender disparity exists in nicotine consumption, with males consuming more than females.\n\n**Higher education leads to less frequent consumption:** There is an observed trend where individuals who quit school earlier have a higher proportion of nicotine consumers, while those in higher education exhibit fewer nicotine consumers.\n\n**Ireland consumes most, the UK consumes least:** Although there are no significant differences observed among countries for average nicotine consumption levels, notable disparities are evident in the extreme consumption categories: individuals consuming nicotine in the last day and those who never consume. The Republic of Ireland shows a significant proportion of individuals consuming nicotine in the last day, whereas the UK exhibits a significant proportion of individuals who never consume nicotine.\n\n#### Age\n\nThe age group 18-24 exhibits a peak in nicotine consumption this month (CL4), while the 25-34 age group peaks at consumption over the decade (CL2), consistent with their overall higher nicotine consumption levels. Similar trends are observed for the 35-44 and 45-54 age groups, albeit with decreasing frequency as age increases. Notably, nicotine consumption over the decade (CL2), this year (CL3), this month (CL4), and this week (CL5) is absent in the 55-64 and 65+ age groups\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nbreaks <- c(-0.95197, -0.07854, 0.49788, 1.09449, 1.82213, 2.59171)\nlabels <- c(\"18-24\", \"25-34\", \"35-44\", \"45-54\", \"55-64\", \"65+\")\n\nggplot(drug, aes(x = Age, y = Nicotine)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks, labels = labels) +\n  labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Nicotine\", title = \"Age and Nicotine Consumption\")\n```\n\n#### Gender\n\nAt the level of non-consumption (CL0), females comprise 83.56% more than males.

Notably, a majority of individuals over 55 years old exhibit a pattern of non-consumption.\n\n**Males consume more:** There is a significant gender difference in cannabis consumption, with a higher proportion of males consuming cannabis compared to females. Additionally, a majority of females do not consume cannabis.\n\n**Higher education lead to increased non-consumption:** While no clear trend is observable among consumers, a greater proportion of individuals pursuing higher education report never consuming cannabis.\n\n**The USA consumes most, the UK consumes least:** While cannabis consumption is prevalent across most countries surveyed, the USA stands out for its higher frequency of consumption. Conversely, the UK is notable for having the largest proportion of individuals who never consume cannabis.\n\n#### Age\n\nIndividuals aged 18-24 are predominantly observed to consume cannabis within the last day (CL6).

Despite these variations, both genders display a similar pattern of alcohol consumption, with the majority having consumed alcohol at some stage and only a small proportion never having consumed alcohol at all.\n\n**Minor difference caused by educational background:** Alcohol consumption patterns, especially at higher consumption levels, do not differ significantly across different educational levels.\n\n**Differences caused by country seen in more recent consumption:** There is a consistent pattern of alcohol non-consumption to distant past consumption across the six compared countries. However, when examining more recent alcohol consumption, distinct differences between countries emerge. Specifically, New Zealand, Canada, and the Republic of Ireland exhibit higher frequencies of drinking.\n\n#### Age\n\nThere is an observable overall decline in alcohol consumption as age increases. The proportion of individuals who have never consumed alcohol (CL0) diminishes with advancing age. The peak occurrence for those who last consumed alcohol over a decade ago (CL1) is found within the 45-54 age bracket. The age group most likely to have consumed alcohol in the last decade (CL2) is 35-44. For more recent consumption categories—consumed in the last year (CL3), last month (CL4), last week (CL5), and last day (CL6)—the majority are in the youngest age group, 18-24.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nbreaks <- c(-0.95197, -0.07854, 0.49788, 1.09449, 1.82213, 2.59171)\nlabels <- c(\"18-24\", \"25-34\", \"35-44\", \"45-54\", \"55-64\", \"65+\")\n\nggplot(drug, aes(x = Age, y = Alcohol)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks, labels = labels) +\n  labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Alcohol\", title = \"Age and Alcohol Consumption\")\n```\n\n#### Gender\n\nA smaller portion of the surveyed population, 16.68% of females and 19.05% of males, includes individuals who have never consumed alcohol (CL0) or those who last consumed alcohol up to a year ago (CL3).

This trend suggests that caffeine consumption may decrease as individuals age, particularly after passing the 55-year mark.\n\n**Minor difference caused by gender:** Both males and females exhibit similar patterns of caffeine consumption, with both genders showing a high level of caffeine intake. There is no significant gender difference influencing the frequency of caffeine consumption.\n\n**Certain difference caused by educational background:** Individuals who left school at the age of 17 exhibit a higher incidence of caffeine consumption on a more frequent basis compared to other educational background groups. However, it is important to note that this difference could potentially be due to chance, *warranting further investigation*.\n\n**Minor difference caused by country:** All countries exhibit a high frequency of consuming caffeine in the last day, with no significant differences observed among them.\n\n#### Age\n\nLast-week (CL5) and last-day (CL6) caffeine consumption is predominantly observed in the younger age brackets, specifically those aged 18-24 and 25-34. There is a noticeable decline in caffeine consumption among individuals in the 55-64 age group. Furthermore, the peak of caffeine consumption 'over a decade ago' (CL1) is most evident in the 35-44 age category, which aligns with the finding that caffeine consumption is most prevalent among those currently in the 18-24 and 25-34 age groups.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nbreaks <- c(-0.95197, -0.07854, 0.49788, 1.09449, 1.82213, 2.59171)\nlabels <- c(\"18-24\", \"25-34\", \"35-44\", \"45-54\", \"55-64\", \"65+\")\n\nggplot(drug, aes(x = Age, y = Caff)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks, labels = labels) +\n  labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Caffeine\", title = \"Age and Caffeine Consumption\")\n```\n\n#### Gender\n\nThe majority of surveyed individuals consume caffeine either on a daily basis (CL6), with 24.64% female and 29.15% male respondents, or on a weekly basis (CL5), with 42.98% females and 37.51% males.

For individuals aged 35-44 and 45-54, the proportion of those who consumed heroin a decade ago (CL1) gradually increases.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nbreaks <- c(-0.95197, -0.07854, 0.49788, 1.09449, 1.82213, 2.59171)\nlabels <- c(\"18-24\", \"25-34\", \"35-44\", \"45-54\", \"55-64\", \"65+\")\n\nggplot(drug, aes(x = Age, y = Heroin)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks, labels = labels) +\n  labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Heroin\", title = \"Age and Heroin Consumption\")\n```\n\n#### Gender\n\n89.83% of females and 80.14% of males report never consuming heroin (CL0), with no significant gender differences observed across other consumption levels.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ncount_data <- drug_or %>%\n  group_by(Heroin, Gender) %>%\n  summarise(count = n())\n\ncustom_colors <- c(\"F\" = \"#aed0ee\", \"M\" = \"#a3bbdb\")\n\nggplot(count_data, aes(x = Heroin, y = count, fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = count), position = position_dodge(width = 1), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Gender and Heroin Consumption\", x = \"Heroin Consumption Levels\", y = \"Count\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n#### Education\n\nIndividuals with doctorate degrees, master's degrees, university degrees, and some professional certificates tend to exhibit a slightly larger proportion of non-consumers of heroin (CL0), although the difference is not significant.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\neducation_hero_counts <- drug_or %>%\n  group_by(Education, Heroin) %>%\n  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%\n  group_by(Education) %>%\n  mutate(percentage = count / sum(count) * 100)\n\neducation_levels_ordered <- c(\n  \"Doctorate degree\", \"Masters degree\", \"University degree\",\n  \"Professional certificate/ diploma\", \n  \"Some college or university, no certificate or degree\", \n  \"Left school at 18 years\", \"Left school at 17 years\",\n  \"Left school at 16 years\", \"Left school before 16 years\"\n)\neducation_hero_counts$Education <- factor(education_hero_counts$Education, levels = education_levels_ordered)\n\ncustom_colours <- c(\"#aed0ee\", \"#a3bbdb\", \"#88abda\", \"#8aabcc\", \"#6f94cd\", \"#5976ba\", \"#106898\", \"#12507b\", \"#003460\")\n\nggplot(education_hero_counts, aes(x = Education, y = percentage, fill = Heroin)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colours, name = \"Consumption Level\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)  # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability\n  ) +\n  labs(title = \"Education and Heroin Consumption\",\n       x = \"Education Level\",\n       y = \"Percentage\",\n       fill = \"Consumption Level\")\n```\n\n#### Country\n\nThe UK has the largest proportion of people who never consume heroin (CL0), whereas New Zealand has the least.
